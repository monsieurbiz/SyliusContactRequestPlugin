This plugin allows you to customize the contact page on the front-end of your Sylius store. It stores all contact requests made through the native Sylius form in the database, making them accessible directly from the Sylius back office.

```

```

## Getting started

### Contact page customization

![Demo of the Contact Request](docs/images/settings.jpg)

### Contact request storage

Submit a contact request from the native contact form. Them go in the back-office in the customer menu node you will have a new menu 'contact requests', click on it and 
you can see a grid with the contact requests created.
Obviously, this plugin is not retroactive and contact requests made before the plugin was installed will not be displayed.

### For the installation without flex, follow these additional steps

Change your `config/bundles.php` file to add this line for the plugin declaration:

```php
<?php

return [
    //..
    MonsieurBiz\SyliusContactRequestPlugin\MonsieurBizSyliusContactRequestPlugin::class => ['all' => true],
];
```

Create a new file `config/packages/monsieurbiz_sylius_contact_request.yaml` and add the following configuration:

```yaml
imports:
  - { resource: "@MonsieurBizSyliusContactRequestPlugin/Resources/config/config.yaml" }
```

Create a new file `config/routes/monsieurbiz_sylius_contact_request.yaml` and add the following configuration:

```yaml
imports:
    resource: '@MonsieurBizSyliusContactRequestPlugin/Resources/config/routes.yaml'
```

To override the default sylius route for contact page, create a new file `config/routes/sylius_shop_contact_request_override.yaml` and add the following configuration:

```yaml
sylius_shop_contact_request:
    path: /{_locale}/contact
    requirements:
        _locale: ^[A-Za-z]{2,4}(_([A-Za-z]{4}|[0-9]{3}))?(_([A-Za-z]{2}|[0-9]{3}))?$
    methods: [GET, POST]
    defaults:
        _controller: sylius.controller.shop.contact::requestAction
        _sylius:
            redirect: sylius_shop_homepage
            template: '@MonsieurBizSyliusContactRequestPlugin/Shop/ContactRequest/request.html.twig'
```

This is the same as Sylius route configuration instead of the template key which is overridden to use the plugin template.
